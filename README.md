The *Restaurant Order Analytics* project is designed to help restaurant managers gain valuable insights into customer ordering behavior and optimize operational efficiency. By analyzing historical order data, this project identifies:

## The most frequently ordered dishes

## Customer preferences across different meal times

## Peak order periods based on time, day, and customer type

Using data visualization tools such as Power BI or Python, the project categorizes orders by meal time (Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, Dinner), dish name, and customer type (e.g., Regular, New). It also allows filtering by day of the week and customer segments to uncover specific trends and patterns.
